# Cardon!

A new Flutter project.

## Inspiration
I've been watching a lot of livestreams of card games recently, and it looks like a lot of fun! I've always loved card games. I'm also a big fan of party games because they bring people together and create a lot of enjoyment. Plus, I think party games have a unique way of combining fun, social and learning, which is something I really enjoy.

## What it does
"Cardon!" focuses on four key factors: Energy Production, Transportation, Industry, and Agriculture. Each card represents a different activity related to these factors, with numbers ranging from 0 to 9 indicating the level of carbon emissions associated with each activity. The game aims to educate users about the environmental impact of various activities while providing an engaging gaming experience. Additionally, the cards feature different effects and actions, simulating the consequences of these activities and highlighting their influence on the environment.

## How we built it
We built "Cardon!" using Flutter and Firebase, leveraging the capabilities of these technologies to create a simple card game using the template from Flutter Casual Games Toolkit.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we encountered was learning the Flutter Casual Games Toolkit, which required navigating through various segmented components. Additionally, ensuring smooth data streaming for optimal performance posed a significant challenge. Time constraints prevented us from addressing all aspects of the project, leaving some features incomplete.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the challenges, we are proud to have developed a satisfying end product that combines entertainment with education.

## What we learned
Through this project, we gained valuable experience in game development using Flutter, expanding our skill set in mobile app development.

## What's next for Cardon!
Moving forward, we plan to address several issues and implement additional features to enhance the gaming experience. These include:
- Handling Player Inactivity: Implementing mechanisms to manage player inactivity, such as automatically taking actions for inactive players or removing them from the game.
- Managing Overflowing Cards: Implementing solutions to prevent the accumulation of excessive cards on the playing area, ensuring a smooth and clutter-free gameplay experience.
- Automating Actions When the Game Timer Expires: Introducing automated actions or effects when the game timer reaches its expiration, adding an element of urgency and excitement to the gameplay.
- Enhancing the Game with Visually Appealing Card Art and Audios: Improving the aesthetic appeal of the game by adding visually captivating card art and enhancing the auditory experience with engaging sound effects and background music.
